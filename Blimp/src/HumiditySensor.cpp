/*
WIRING - DHT22 
- Connect pin 1 (on the left) of the sensor to +3.3V |u punt√≠ku|
- Connect pin 2 of the sensor to DHTPIN (22)
- Do not connect pin 3
- Connect pin 4 (on the right) of the sensor to GROUND
- Connect a 10K resistor from pin 2 (data) to pin 1 (power) of the sensor - It's pull-up resistor
