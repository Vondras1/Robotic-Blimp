Robotic Blimp repository: This repository contains all necessary resources for building and controlling a robotic blimp. Structure:

Blimp 
  - include - Header files .h for blimp implementation
  - src - Source files .cpp for blimp implementation

Controller 
  - include - Header files .h for controller implementation
  - src - Source files .cpp for controller implementation
    
ConstructionFiles
  - 3Dmodels - Models for printing
  - PCB
    
ControllerApp.exe - Control application

Media - Photos and videos from airship testing

Vzducholod.pdf - Bachelor's thesis

The blimp was designed as part of my bachelor's thesis. Detailed description of its design and construction can be found in the actual work vzducholod.pdf. Demonstrations of the airship's flights can be found in the media folder. It is also important to note that the project still offers a number of improvements, with the most significant being the control of the flight direction, which still offers considerable opportunities for improvement. The project is publicly available, so feel free to expand it or simply adapt its individual parts.
