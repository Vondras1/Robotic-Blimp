ControllerApp.exe - Control application

Media - Photos and videos from airship testing

Vzducholod.pdf - Bachelor's thesis

-----------------
The blimp was designed as part of my bachelor's thesis. A detailed description of its design and construction can be found in the document itself, vzducholod.pdf. Demonstrations of the airship's flights can be found in the media folder. It is also important to note that the project offers a number of enhancements, with the most significant being the control of flight direction, which still presents considerable opportunities for improvement. The project is publicly available, so feel free to expand or simply adapt its individual parts.
